      <h2><b>Present perfect and simple past</b></h2>
      <br>
      <h3>present perfect: have / has + past <span class="color-red">pa</span>rticiple (worked, seen, etc.)</h3>
      <br>

      <p>Have you head about the Ocean Titan submersible accident?</p>
      <p>They have found the debris near the Titanic wreck.</p>
      <br>
      <p>1 We use the present perfect for <span class="color-red">past experiences</span> when we don't say exactly when they happened.</p>
      <br>
      <div class="container-white">
        <p>I<span class="color-green"><b>'ve inherited</b></span> some money, but I <span class="color-green"><b>haven't spent</b></span> it.</p>
        <p>Sally <span class="color-green"><b>has</b></span> never <span class="color-green"><b>met</b></span> Bill's ex-wife.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>We often use ever and never when we talk or ask about past experiences. They go before the main verb.</p>

      <br>
      <div class="container-white">
        
        </p>
        <p>Have you ever been abroad? <span class="color-lightgray">Você alguma vez já foi para o exterior?</span></p>
        <p>Have you ever met your favorite actor/actress?</p>
        <p>Have you ever lost your credit card?</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <p>2 In American English, we also use the present perfect and the simple past with yet and already. </p>
      <br>
      <div>
        <p>I did it already.</p>
        <p>I didn't finished yet.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div class="container-white">
        <p><b>with yet and already (for emphasis)</b></p>
        <br>
        <p>We use already in (+) sentences. It goes before the main verb.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I<span class="color-green"><b>'ve</b></span> <u>already</u> <span class="color-green"><b>seen</b></span> this movie twice.
          Can't we watch another one?</p>
          <br>
          <p>We use yet with <i>negative</i> sentences and <i>questions</i>. It goes at the end of the phrase.</p>
          <br>
        <p>My brother <span class="color-green"><b>hasn't found</b></span> a new job <u>yet</u>. He's still looking.</p>
        <p><span><b>A:</b></span> <span class="color-green"><b>"Have</b></span> you <span
            class="color-green"><b>finished</b></span> your homework? <span><b>B:</b></span> No, not <u>yet</u>.</p>
      </div>
      <br>
      <h3><b>simple past (worked, stopped, went, had, etc.)</b></h3>
      <br>

      <p>I watched a movie last night.</p>
      <p>They got married last year.</p>
      <p>I met my teacher at the mall two weeks ago.</p>
      <p>I didn't have time to do my homework.</p>
      <p>What time did you wake up this morning?</p>
      <br>
      <p>We use the simple past for finished past actions. (when we say, ask, or know when they happened.)</p>
      <br>
