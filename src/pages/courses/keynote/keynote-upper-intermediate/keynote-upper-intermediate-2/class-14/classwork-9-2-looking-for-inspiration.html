            <p><b>RELATIVE CLAUSES</b></p>
            <br>
            <p><b><u>Defining relative clauses</u></b></p>
            <br>
            <div class="container-white">
            <p class="justify">We form defining relative clauses with the relative pronouns <i>who, that, which, whose, where</i> and <i>when</i>. The defining relative clause gives information about the noun that precedes it in the sentence. The information in a defining relative clause is essential for the sentence to make sense: it identifies exactly what is being referred to.</p>
            <br>
                <p><i>These are <b>the people who</b> saw the advert.</i></p>
                <p><b><i>The people who</b> saw this advert won’t forget it.</i></p>
                <p><i>That’s<b> the company which</b> needs the advert.</i></p>
                <p><b><i>The company which</b> needs the advert sells footwear and accessories.</i></p>
                <p><i>She’s <b>the designer that</b> came up with the logo.</i></p>
                <p><i>The designer that came up with the logo is fantastic.</i></p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="container-white">
            <p>The relative pronouns <i>who, which</i> and <i>that</i> can be both the subject and the object in a sentence. in the examples above, the relative pronouns are the subject of the defining relative clause and they are followed by a verb. The relative pronouns must be included.</p>
            <br>
                <p><i>These are <b>the people who</b> saw the advert.</i></p>
                <p><s><i>(These are <b>the people saw</b> the advert.)</i></s></p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="container-white">
            <p>When the relative pronoun is followed by a subject + verb, it is the object of the defining relative clause. it can be omitted. </p>
            <br>
                <p><i>These are the people <b>who we showed</b> the advert to.</i></p>
                <p><i>These are the people <b>we showed</b> the advert to.</i></p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="container-white">
                <p>We use defining relative clauses with pronouns as follows: </p>
                <br>
                <p><i><b>•</b> who</i> to identify people</p>
                <p><i><b>The designer who</b> thought of this concept is a genius.</i></p>
                <br>
                <p><b>•</b> <i>which</i> to identify things </p>
                <p><i><b>The idea which</b> the team came up with was great.</i></p>
                <br>
                <p><b>•</b> <i>that</i> to identify people and things. This is less formal than <i>who</i> and <i>which</i>. </p>
                <p><i><b>The designer that</b></i> thought of this concept is a genius.</p>
                <p><i><b>The idea that</b></i> the team came up with was great.</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>•</b> <i>whose</i> to talk about possession</p>
                <p><i><b>The agency whose</b> advert went viral last year has won an award.</i>
    </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>•</b> <i>where</i> to identify places </p>
                <p><i><b>The building where</b> they held the exhibition was beautiful.</i>
    </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>•</b> <i>when</i> to identify times</p>
                <p><i>Monday’s <b>the day when</b> everyone arrives late.</i></p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p><b><u>Non-defining relative clauses</u></b></p>
            <br>
            <div class="container-white">
            <p>non-defining relative clauses give information about the noun which is not essential to the sentence – the information can be omitted and the sentence will still make sense. We separate a non-defining relative clause from the rest of the sentence with commas.</p>
            <br>
                <p><i>The <b>client</b>, <b>who</b> makes children’s <b>toys</b>, is keen to see our ideas.</i></p>
                <p><i>These <b>toys</b>, <b>which</b> are made by our client, are really popular with the under-fives.</i></p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="container-white">
            <p>A non-defining relative clause can also come at the end of a sentence. in this case, only one comma is used.</p>
            <br>
                <p><i>This is our most recent <b>client</b>, <b>who</b> makes children’s toys.</i></p>
                <p><i>Our client makes these <b>toys</b>, <b>which</b> are really popular with the under-fives.</i></p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <div class="container-white">
            <p>The same relative pronouns are used in non-defining relative clauses as in defining relative clauses, with the exception of <i>that</i>.</p>
            <br>
                <p><i>The <b>client</b>, <s>that</s> <b>who</b> makes children’s toys, is keen to see our ideas.</i></p>
                <p><i>Our client makes these <b>toys</b>, <s>that</s> <b>which</b> are really popular with the under-fives.</i></p>
            </div>
            <br>
            <p><b><u>Reduced relative clauses</u></b></p>
            <br>
            <div class="container-white">
                <p>Reduced relative clauses never include relative pronouns. We form a reduced relative clause by replacing the relative pronoun and using an -ing form or past participle. </p>
                <br>
                <p><b>•</b> We use -ing when the relative clause is in the active form.</p>
                <p><i><b>Visitors arriving</b> by car can park for free. (who arrive / who are arriving</i>)</p>
                <br>
                <p><b>•</b> We use a part participle when the relative clause is in the passive form.</p>
                <p><i>Some of <b>the adverts shown</b> on TV are terrible. (which are shown)</i></p>
