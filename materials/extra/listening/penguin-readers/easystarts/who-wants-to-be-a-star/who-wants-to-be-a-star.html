                wants. But is she happy? Does she want to be a star?

                angry with her mother and Mrs Daniels is angry with Tina. Tina leaves the room and cries.

                Tina is very sad. She does not want to be a star. She wants a quiet life. One day she has an idea. Her school friend, Mary, has a grandmother Mrs White. Old Mrs White lives in the country, in Stonechurch. Tina has a photo of Mary in front of Mrs White's house. It looks very pretty — not like the city! Tina decides to go there.

When's the next train?” Tina asks. “The train leaves at two o'clock from platform three,” the man says. Tina buys her ticket.

She goes to the front door and rings the bell. And an old lady with white hair and a kind face opens the door. A black cat comes out too.
