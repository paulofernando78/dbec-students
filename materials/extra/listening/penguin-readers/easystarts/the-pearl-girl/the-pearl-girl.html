                Kate is very scared. She looks round the kitchen. Suddenly, she sees a ship in a bottle. There is a pen next to it. Quickly she writes a note. It says: “I’m on the Black Dog with two thieves. They have ‘Girl with a Pearl Earring’. Call the police! My name is Kate Grant.” Then she puts her note in the bottle. She opens the small window and throws the bottle into the canal.
