        <p class="justify">Before the advent of streaming Blockbuster was a popular video rental store where customers
            could
            rent their favourite movies on VHS tapes or DVDs and watch them at home. While it’s hard to imagine
            having to leave the comfort of your home to rent a movie, at one time in the 1990s and the early
            2000s Blockbuster was extremely popular. It was the largest video rental company in the world with
            over 9,000 stores and over 50 million members. Fast forward 20 years and now there is only one
            Blockbuster store left in Bend Oregon.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="justify">So what happened? While most talk of Blockbuster’s <span class="tooltip2">demise <span

            Blockbuster
            made many strategic errors throughout its history that caused it to have such a stunning <span
                class="tooltip2"><span style="border-bottom: 2px dotted;">fall from grace</span> <span
                    class="tooltip2-info"><b>fall from grace</b> a situation
                    in which you do something that makes people in authority stop liking you or admiring you: • The
                    finance
                    minister's fall from grace gave his enemies great satisfaction. <span class="color-lightgrey">A
                        queda do
                        ministro das Finanças deu grande satisfação aos seus inimigos.</span></span></span>. If you are
            curious
            about
            why only one Blockbuster store remains today then consider these
            eight reasons for why it is no longer the juggernaut it once was.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>1. Walking away from the deal of the century.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p class="justify">Blockbuster made a critical error when it walked away
            from a deal with Netflix. Netflix wanted to sell its company to Blockbuster for $50 million in 2000, yes
            this really happened. Netflix was still a young upstart in those days having only launched its business
            three years earlier. If the deal went through Netflix would have managed Blockbuster’s online
            business.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="justify">At the time Blockbuster could have afforded the purchase price since it had raised $465
            million in an
            IPO a year earlier. But Blockbuster passed on the deal claiming the price was too high. Speaking about
            what happened, Netflix’s former CFO Barry McCarthy says Blockbuster “laughed us out of their
            office.”</p>
        <br>
        <p class="justify">Three years after Blockbuster turned down Netflix’s offer Netflix had more than one million
            subscribers and by 2006 Netflix had six million subscribers. Before too long Netflix was no longer the
            underdog, it was building a loyal and growing customer base.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>2. An inability to pivot quickly.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p class="justify">Blockbuster was skeptical about the potential of renting DVDs online
            and sending them to customers via mail the way Netflix did. But customers enjoyed Netflix’s service
            because it was convenient. You no longer had to go to a Blockbuster to get the movie you wanted to
            see or the video game you wanted to play. Instead you could simply go online, select the movie you
            wanted to see and voila it would show up in your mailbox a few days later. It’s not unlike Amazon’s
            entrance into the eCommerce market in the 1990s. Amazon provided a more convenient way to shop
            but it was difficult for many companies at that time to see the potential of eCommerce. As Netflix
            continued to gain subscribers it took Blockbuster six years to launch a similar service of its own in
            2004 called Blockbuster Online.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="justify">While Netflix was able to eat its own lunch by launching a small streaming service in 2007
            which
            would eventually displace its video rental business Blockbuster was unable to pivot fast enough again
            into streaming, essentially sealing its fate. “My greatest fear at Netflix has been that we wouldn’t
            make the leap from success in DVDs to success in streaming. Most companies that are great at
            something — like AOL (AOL) dialup or Borders bookstores – do not become great at new things
            people want (streaming for us) because they are afraid to hurt their initial business. Eventually these
            companies realize their error of not focusing enough on the new thing, and then the company fights
            desperately and hopelessly to recover. Companies rarely die from moving too fast, and they
            frequently die from moving too slowly,” said Reid Hastings, Netflix’s co-founder and co-CEO.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>3. Poor execution.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p class="justify">One of Blockbuster’s main sources of revenues were late fees. If you didn’t return
            your movie rental on time you were charged a dollar a day. Those fees amounted to $800 million in
            2000 or 16% of Blockbuster’s revenues. Netflix on the other hand did not charge any late fees at all
            just one flat fee. In fact, Hastings started Netflix because he was annoyed about a $40 late fee he had
            to pay for renting out Apollo 13 from Blockbuster.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="justify">But to compete with Netflix’s growing business Blockbuster ending up cancelling late fees
            putting a
            dent in its revenues. But even when Blockbuster cancelled late fees it couldn’t catch a break. It faced
            a new challenge in that customers started to keep movies for longer periods of time, since there was
            no penalty, meaning that those titles weren’t available to be rented out to others.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="justify">In 2006 Blockbuster launched a program called Total Access where online customers could
            return
            rentals to Blockbuster stores and in exchange they received a DVD rental for free all for one low flat
            fee. The program was hugely successful but it came at a cost, Blockbuster lost $2 each time a
            customer exchanged a DVD through the program. To stem heavy losses from the program Blockbuster
            had to raise the price of the program causing customer churn.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>4. Inability to compete with larger rivals.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p class="justify">While many focus on Netflix’s singular role in Blockbuster’s
            demise big box retailers like Walmart, Target and Best Buy also played a role. They priced DVDs
            cheaply using them as loss leaders to get customers in the door. That reduced the need for customers
            to rent as many DVDs eating into Blockbuster’s revenues.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>5. A flawed business model.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p class="justify">Blockbuster struggled financially throughout much of its history. For
            example, between 1996 and 2010 Blockbuster was only profitable in two of those years which brings
            into question the overall viability of Blockbuster’s business model even before other competitors
            entered the market making it even more difficult for Blockbuster to succeed.</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>6. Activist investors with the wrong vision.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p class="justify">Carl Icahn, an activist investor on Blockbuster’s board fought against Blockbuster’s move
            into the online rental business preferring the company to stick
            with its brick and mortar roots. To this end Icahn led the ouster of John Antioco who was
            Blockbuster’s CEO for a decade staring in 1997 and then installed Jim Keys as CEO of Blockbuster, in
            2007.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="justify">Keys, like Icahn, was committed to Blockbuster’s brick and mortar business. Niko Celentano a
            former
            Blockbuster shareholder wrote this about Keys after Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010: “Jim
            Keyes is the main reason Blockbuster is in this position today due to his denial of being in a business
            model that did not work anymore. If Jim Keyes would have seen the changes that were evolving in
            this industry in the past few years, Blockbuster would not have been in the courts today filing Chapter
            11 bk protection.... Jim Keyes has failed in his job as CEO of Blockbuster and should resign
            immediately."</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>7. A heavy debt burden.</b></p>
        <br>
        <p class="justify">Viacom bought Blockbuster in 1994 and then spun it out in 2004. As part of
            the deal Blockbuster had to pay a $5 per share dividend which caused Blockbuster to take out a $905
            million loan to pay for the dividend. By the time Blockbuster filed for bankruptcy in 2010 it had $1
            billion in debt. “If it hadn’t been for their debt, they could have killed us,” said Hastings.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="justify">In bankruptcy proceedings Blockbuster was acquired by Dish Network for $320 million a far cry
            from
            the Blockbuster of 2004 when it generated $5.9 billion in revenues. Then in 2013 Dish Network
            announced it was closing nearly all of the remaining Blockbuster stores in the United States which
            had dwindled down to about 300 at that time.</p>
        <br>
        <p class="justify">Looking back, Icahn says: “Blockbuster turned out to be the worst investment I ever made. It
            failed
            because of too much debt and changes in the industry. It had too many stores, Netflix created a
            better business model, and then Redbox kiosks and the whole digital phenomenon eliminated the
            need for consumers to go to a separate DVD store.”</p>
        <br>
        <p><b>8.</b>
            <span class="tooltip2"><span style="border-bottom: 2px dotted;"><b>Hubris</b></span>
                <span class="tooltip2-info"><b>Hubris</b>
                    <span class="times-new-roman"><i>noun</i></span>
                    <span class="phonetics"> /ˈhjuː.brɪs/ </span>
                    refers to excessive pride or self-confidence, often leading to arrogance and a disregard for potential consequences.
                    It's a word often used in situations where someone's overconfidence or arrogance leads to negative outcomes. • Her hubris in thinking she could complete the challenging marathon without proper training resulted in a painful injury
                    that taught her a valuable lesson.

            </span>
        </p>

        <br>
        <p class="justify">“I’ve been frankly confused by this fascination that everybody has with Netflix...Netflix
            doesn’t really have or do anything that we can’t or don’t already do ourselves,” said Keyes in 2008.
            Two years later Blockbuster was bankrupt. A healthy degree of hubris ended up being the fatal thorn
            in Blockbuster’s side. Blockbuster couldn’t see past its previous success to see the change on the
            horizon and then once it did it was too slow to react.</p>
