                This is the story of Hapu. He lives in Ancient Egypt at the time of Queen Cleopatra. His father, Bak, has a small
                factory. He makes gold tables and chairs. Hapu helps him. He is a 'fireboy'. Every day he pushes a long handle up and
                down. The work is hot and very hard. But what can he and his father do? They are poor people. They need to make money.

                we're going to be very rich," he tells Hapu. "Are we?" The fireboy looks into his father's tired eyes. "Yes," Bak
                smiles. "I don't know how and I don't know when, but we are." Then he stands up. "Come on," he says. "It's late. Let's
                go home."

                Three days later Hapu and Bak are making a table. It is very hot in the room. Suddenly Bak stops work. "What is it,
                father? Hapu asks. "Is something wrong?" "I don't know," Bak answers. He closes his eyes. "It's my head. I can't..." And
                then he falls to the ground. "Father!" Hapu runs to Bak and puts one hand under his head. "Father — are you all right?"

                "Of course!" he thinks "I must make something for somebody very rich. Somebody like ... the Queen!"

                early. They want to buy lots of new clothes for her." "That's very good news," Hapu thinks.

                long time, nothing happens. Then the music starts to play. A moment later Hapu sees a long line of people. They are
                coming from the palace.
