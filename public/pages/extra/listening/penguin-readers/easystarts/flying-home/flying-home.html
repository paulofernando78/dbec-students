                Felix is not a happy bird. He comes from Brazil but he doesn't live there. He lives in New York in a
                cage. Then one day
                his cage opens and Felix says goodbye to New York. Can he find his family in Brazil again?

                Felix is a blue and yellow bird from Brazil. He lives with the Baxter family in New York. His home is a
                big cage. It is
                on the fortieth floor of a tall building. Felix likes the Baxters, and the Baxters like him, they give
                him food. They
                talk to him and show him to all their friends. But Felix isn’t happy. He wants to go home to Brazil.

                the Baxters,
                but not for Felix. He remembers the big, yellow moon in Brazil. Then he remembers his last day in the
                jungle. The two men with white hats. The big box. The long plane journey. The shop - "Beautiful Birds" -
                in New York.

                life he loves. "I want to be with my family again," he thinks. "I want to fly home to the jungle. It's
                warm there and the trees are always green." He puts his head under one wing. "One day," he says. "One
                day."

                goes to the phone, but forgets to shut Felix's cage. Felix can see an open window. "This is it!" he
                thinks.

                Felix!!" but he doesn't go back. He looks down at the streets and buildings and flies through the city.
                A girl in a cafe with her mother sees him. "Look!" she says. Her mother does not hear. She is reading
                her newspaper.

                he is happy, too. For the first time in two years, he is free. He wants to fly all night.

                Two hours later it starts to rain. Now the sky is black. Soon, Felix can't see the moon or the stars.
                "Where am I?" he thinks. He remembers his warm cage. "Am I doing the right thing?" He looks down at the
                cold sea. Then he sees something. Is it a star in the black water? No, it can't be a star. He looks
                again. It is a ship!

                take a photograph
                of him. Felix flies into the sky again. "Good," he thinks. "It's not raining now, and I'm not hungry."

                Two days later Felix flies across Peru. He looks down and sees the Inca city of Machu Picchu. "Those old
                stone buildings look interesting," he thinks. "I know - I can stop there tonight." Felix starts to fly
                down to the buildings. Then he sees a big bird with beautiful black and white feathers. It is sitting on
                a stone.
