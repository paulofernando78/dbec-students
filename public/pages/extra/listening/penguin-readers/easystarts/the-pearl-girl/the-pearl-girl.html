                Kate Grant is fifteen and comes from Canada. She is visiting the Netherlands with her mother and father.
                On June 8th, the Grants are at a museum in The Hague. "This is very good". Mr. Grant says. He is looking
                at a picture of an old man. "Yes," Mrs. Grants says. "What do you think, Kate?" "It's OK," Kate says.
                She looks at her watch. It is 4:45.

                She looks at the girl's face. "Who are you?" she thinks. "What are you looking at?" "That's a very
                famous picture," Mrs. Grant says. A sign next to it says, "Girl with a Pearl Earring." "It's beautiful,"
                Kate says.

                asks. "No, Carl. You have it," Mrs. Grant says. They look for the guide book in their bags, then Mr.
                Grant says, "Oh no, I remember now. It's on a chair near 'Girl with a Pearl Earring'. My passport is in
                that book!" Kate gets up quickly. "Stay here, she says. "I can find it."

                with an earring,” Kate says. They walk for a minute, then Paul Van Dyck stops. “Sshh!” he says. "I can

                He takes a phone from his coat pocket, but suddenly there are two men in the room. One is tall and has a
                big, black bag in his hands. The short man has a gun. They look at Kate and Paul. Kate and Paul look
                a(t) the men. Time stops.

                She opens the small window and throws the bottle into the canal.
