                Marcel is a mouse and a famous detective. He lives in Paris. One evening, two thieves steal a very expensive diamond
                ring - the 'White Star'. Then they steal a car. Marcel follows them across Paris to a cafe. Can he get the 'White Star'
                and bring it back?

                Marcel is a French mouse. He lives on a beautiful old boat in Paris. (His home is under the kitchen floor.) He likes
                books, restaurants and old films. He likes the opera, too. One evening in June, Marcel finishes a detective story. Then
                he goes to have dinner with some friends. They live in the metro station at the Louvre.

                After dinner, Marcel waits at the station. He sees two men standing next to him. The tall one is reading a magazine,
                “Look,” he says, “here she is: “Opera star Miss Zaza Dupont with her beautiful one million pound diamond ring — the
                White Star.’ “ “‘Her’ beautiful diamond ring?” The short man looks at the photo and laughs. “Not after tonight,” he
                says.

                Marcel’s mouth opens. “What?! Are the men going to steal Zaza Dupont’s diamond?” He remembers an evening at the opera
                two weeks before. Zaza’s green dress. The music. The beautiful White Star on her finger. No! They can’t steal it! The
                train comes and the men get on. Marcel pulls down his hat and follows them.

                Half an hour later he gets off again at La Mouette station. But there are hundreds of people, and Marcel loses the two
                men. Then he sees an old mouse. “Excuse me,” he says. “Do you know where Zaza Dupont lives?” But when Marcel finds
                Zaza’s house, it is too late. “Yes — two men,” she is telling the police on the telephone. “And they've got the White
                Star.”

                At that moment Marcel hears a motor start. “Where’s that coming from?” he thinks. Then he sees something at the end of
                the road. It's them! It's the thieves and they’re stealing a car! He runs across Zaza’s garden and down the street. He
                can see the car’s number-plate. It’s near. Very near. “Can I …?” he thinks, and he jumps.

                thieves drive across Paris very fast. Marcel can hear them in the car. They are laughing and talking. But Marcel is not
                laughing. He is very, very angry. After half an hour the car stops next to a cafe.

                It is late and the cafe is quiet. In one corner there is a woman. The thieves sit at her table. Marcel sits under the
                table and listens. “Have you got it?” the woman asks. The tall man takes a box from his jacket. Then he opens it.
                “Look,” he says. “Ahhh!” The woman puts a hand to her mouth. “What a beautiful diamond!” “This is it,” thinks Marcel.
                “This is the moment.”

                across the room. “What’s that on the floor?” one waiter asks. “I don’t know,” says another. “Is it...? No, it can’t be a
                diam…” But before he can finish, Marcel runs across the room. He puts the White Star around his neck. Then he runs to
                the door.

                The thieves jump up and follow him. Suddenly there are tables and chairs everywhere. “What’s happening?” an old man

                man. “Shut the door!” says the short one. But they are too late. Marcel runs out of the cafe and does not look back.

                After ten minutes he stops. There is nobody following him, but... where is he? Marcel looks right and left. Then he sees
                a big, white church. “Ah! — the Sacre coeur,” he thinks. “Now I know where I am.” It is late and there are no metro
                trains, but Marcel is not tired. He walks back to Zaza’s house. When he gets there, she is asleep in bed.

                across the floor and up one leg of the table. “Now…” he thinks, “…it's time to take off the White Star. In the morning
                Zaza is going to be very…” Then Marcel stops. Oh, no! He can't take the ring off. He pulls and pulls, but nothing
                happens.

                some soap on his neck. Then he closes his eyes and pulls again. Yes! This time the diamond ring comes off!
