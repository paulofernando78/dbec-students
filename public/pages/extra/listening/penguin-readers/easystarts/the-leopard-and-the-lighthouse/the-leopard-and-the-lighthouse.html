                One day a leopard swims across the sea to Sindi. He is hungry and he is looking for food. He runs into
                an old lighthouse. The people of Sindi do not want the leopard in their lighthouse. But what can they
                do? How can they catch the leopard?

                Sindi is an island in East Africa. It has beautiful beaches with white sand. The sea is clear and blue.
                There are lovely trees and flowers in Sindi. There is also a small village with white houses. An old
                lighthouse stands near the village on the rocks by the sea. This lighthouse is empty now. Sometimes
                children from the village play in the lighthouse.

                Sindi lies about five hundred metres from the mainland of Africa. A lot of animals live on the mainland
                – monkeys, elephants, and leopards. One day a leopard swims across the sea to Sindi. The leopard is very
                hungry and he is looking for food. He swims quickly. He comes to the beach and gets out of the water.
                Then he walks along the road to the village.

                There is a marketplace in the village. Many people with small children are shopping in the market. They
                are buying meat, vegetables, and fruit. Suddenly the hungry leopard runs into the marketplace. The
                people see him. Children cry and men throw stones. Some of the stones hit the leopard. He runs out of
                the market.

                But where can he run? He sees a small road between two high walls. He turns and runs along this road.
                The people follow him.

                Then, he stops. What now? The people are coming. He sees some stairs. He runs up the stairs – up into
                the building. The building is the old lighthouse.

He brings a goat and some rope to the lighthouse. The leopard is at the top of the lighthouse. Jamal ties the goat to the bottom of the stairs. Then, he waits.
